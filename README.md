# loaf-lang
Compiler/Interpreter for the Loaf programming langage. Currently in progress

Taking inspiration from [Pixeled](https://www.youtube.com/@pixeled-yt/videos)'s [Creating a Compiler](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUDlas_Zy_qC7c5tCgTMYq2idyyT241qs), Robert Nystrom's [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/), and just doing things by the seat of the pants

## Goals
- Python-esque language: whitespace matters
- Static typing
- Main goal is to make a compiler that works correctly :)
