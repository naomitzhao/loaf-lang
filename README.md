# loaf-lang
Compiler/Interpreter for the Loaf programming langage. Currently in progress

Currently based off of [Pixeled](https://www.youtube.com/@pixeled-yt/videos)'s [Creating a Compiler](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUDlas_Zy_qC7c5tCgTMYq2idyyT241qs) 
and Robert Nystrom's [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/).

## Goals
- Syntax similar to C++ but with more syntactic sugar?
- Static typing
- Main goal is to make a compiler that works correctly :)
